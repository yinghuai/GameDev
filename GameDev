Sounds to describe the weather?

I choose this Question because different weather has different corresponding sounds that makes the game more interesting.some times it should support the thunder,lightning,raining,effects that helps it to work.sounds will also affects the emotion of character in the different event and make the player more imaginative and realistic in game.the sound of the weather can make the player more interested on what he's playing,but it should control the timing of the sound that will played and not be annoying.
